Welcome to 
Document Cloud 
Here are four tips to get work done from 
anywhere with Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Sign, 
and Adobe Document Cloud services. 

01  Work where you want 
02  Prepare polished PDFs 
03  Share files with others 
   
04  Get help from Adobe Create, combine, and organize   
02 Prepare polished PDFs

 

It’s easy to create a PDF with 
the exact content you want. 

Make trusted PDFs. Acrobat 
lets you turn practically anything 
into a high-quality PDF that 
looks great on any screen. 
Create a PDF from Microsoft 
Office files, a web page, scanned 
documents, and more. 

Merge multiple files into one PDF. Combine different file 
types—spreadsheets, images, presentations, and web 
pages—into a single PDF file that’s easy to share or archive. 

Organize pages. Drag and drop to reorder pages. You can 
also insert, delete, or rotate pages on your desktop, tablet, or 
mobile device. 
 03 Share files with others  

Send, track, and manage 

 

Now you can share files for 
viewing, commenting, or 
signature—and track status 
every step of the way. 

Share files fast. Click, add, and 
send. It’s that easy. And recipients 
can view on any device with no 
software required. 

Collaborate better. Subscribers can also send files for 
signing or for review to collect group feedback in a single 
shared PDF file.  

Get notifications. Sign in, and we’ll let you know each time 
someone interacts with files you’ve shared. 

Manage your files. You’re in control. Track your file, forward 
it to others, or stop sharing at any time.
