Aaron Finch: "We were about 20 or 30 short. Especially after we lost one wicket, we had to take it deeper. 
But our bowlers did well, continued taking wickets, and they were really good. If you have a guy go on and 
get 80, and that's what you are trying to do. Just a bit more attention to detail. We tried our best with the 
ball. I think our quicks are most effective when they are banging the wicket. There were a few plays-and-
misses, but that happens against a high-quality side."
